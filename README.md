# Rock Paper Scissor
With this project I wanted to embrace my inner Neo !!! I will be designing the game with a Matrix theme.

# The Design
Design 1
When you first load the page you will see the code rain drop affect. This will continue for only a few seconds. From there I want to have the start button appear. 

Design 2
My second design idea is to have the following appear when the landing page loads:
Wake up Neo ...
The Matrix has you ...
Follow the white rabbit.
Knock, knock Neo.
